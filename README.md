Net Speed
=========

Show current net speed on panel.
--------------------------------

This extension is inspired by <https://github.com/biji/simplenetspeed/> which has some annoying flickers existing for a long time so I decide to create my own alternative. I removed all features that I won't use.

It only shows text like `↓ 777 K/s ↑ 2.33 K/s` on the right part of panel. No font size changing, no total downloaded bytes, no bits.
